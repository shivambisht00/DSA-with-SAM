//leetcode 2452: Words Within Two Edits of Dictionary
// You are given two string arrays, queries and dictionary. All words in each array comprise of lowercase English letters and have the same length.

// In one edit you can take a word from queries, and change any letter in it to any other letter. Find all words from queries that, after a maximum of two edits, equal some word from dictionary.

// Return a list of all words from queries, that match with some word from dictionary after a maximum of two edits. Return the words in the same order they appear in queries.


// Example 1:

// Input: queries = ["word","note","ants","wood"], dictionary = ["wood","joke","moat"]
// Output: ["word","note","wood"]
// Explanation:
// - Changing the 'r' in "word" to 'o' allows it to equal the dictionary word "wood".
// - Changing the 'n' to 'j' and the 't' to 'k' in "note" changes it to "joke".
// - It would take more than 2 edits for "ants" to equal a dictionary word.
// - "wood" can remain unchanged (0 edits) and match the corresponding dictionary word.
// Thus, we return ["word","note","wood"].
